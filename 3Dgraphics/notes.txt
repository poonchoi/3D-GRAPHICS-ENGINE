when you write your code using the library you gotta first make an instance of the world space:
    app = World_Space()

in between you can create cubes and shapes and plot points and stuff like that

then at the end you do:
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

this run method (could be called something different later) will project and draw all the points
the run method will also check for keyboard inputs every frame so the user can look around the scene
